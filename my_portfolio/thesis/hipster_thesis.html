    	<h1>Hipsters</h1>
    		<p class="by">By Ronak Patel</p>
    	<h2>Overview</h2>
    	<p>
    		Hipster is a term popularly used to denote a contemporary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture”">subculture </a>in North America and Europe primarily consisting of Millennials living in urban areas.[1] The subculture has been described as a "mutating, trans-Atlantic melting pot of styles, tastes and behavior[s]"[2] and is broadly associated with indie and alternative music, a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility (including vintage and thrift store-bought clothes), progressive or independent political views, organic or artisanal foods, and alternative lifestyles.[3][4][5] Hipsters are typically described as affluent or middle class young Bohemians who reside in gentrifying neighborhoods.

    		The term in its current usage first appeared in the 1990s and became particularly prominent in the 2000s,[8] being derived from earlier movements in the 1940s.[citation needed] Members of the subculture do not self-identify as hipsters, and the word hipster is often used as a pejorative to describe someone who is overly trendy or effete.[9][6] Some analysts contend that the notion of the contemporary hipster is actually a myth created by marketing.[10]
			
			Hipster culture has been described as a "mutating, trans-Atlantic melting pot of styles, tastes and behavior[s]". Christian Lorentzen of Time Out New York argues that "hipsterism fetishizes the authentic" elements of all of the "fringe movements of the postwar era—beat, hippie, punk, even grunge", and draws on the "cultural stores of every unmelted ethnicity", reinventing it "with a winking inauthenticity." Lorentzen says that hipsters are mostly white 18- to 34-year old people. In a Huffington Post article entitled "Who's a Hipster?", Julia Plevin argues that the "definition of 'hipster' remains opaque to anyone outside this self-proclaiming, highly-selective circle." In Rob Horning's April 2009 article "The Death of the Hipster" in PopMatters, he states that the hipster might be the "embodiment of postmodernism as a spent force, revealing what happens when pastiche and irony exhaust themselves as aesthetics." In a New York Times editorial, Mark Greif states that the much-cited difficulty in analyzing the term stems from the fact that any attempt to do so provokes universal anxiety, since it "calls everyone's bluff".
